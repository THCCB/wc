# SSL Connection Issue Solution

## Problem Identified

You're encountering an SSL error when trying to submit the form:

```
FormPage.jsx:160 Submission failed: 
F {message: 'Network Error', name: 'AxiosError', code: 'ERR_NETWORK', config: {…}, request: XMLHttpRequest, …}

FormPage.jsx:151 
POST https://ddcwc.forms.onrender.com/api/submit net::ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH
```

This error (`ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH`) indicates a protocol mismatch between the client and server. 

## Root Cause

After analyzing your code, I've identified several potential causes:

1. **SSL Certificate Issues**: The SSL certificate on your Render.com deployment might be misconfigured or not properly set up.

2. **Mixed Content**: Your application might be mixing HTTP and HTTPS content, which modern browsers block for security reasons.

3. **API URL Configuration**: There might be a mismatch between how the API URL is configured in your environment variables and how it's being used in the application.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Verify Render.com SSL Configuration

- Log into your Render.com dashboard
- Check that SSL is enabled for your web service
- Verify that your custom domain (if any) has proper SSL certificate provisioning

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Ensure your environment variables in Render.com dashboard match these settings:

```
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://ddcwc.forms.onrender.com
VITE_API_URL=https://ddcwc.forms.onrender.com
```

### 3. Modify Frontend Code (if needed)

If the issue persists, you might need to update your axios configuration in `FormPage.jsx` to explicitly handle SSL:

```javascript
const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/api/submit`, form, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'
  },
  // Add these options to handle SSL issues
  httpsAgent: new https.Agent({
    rejectUnauthorized: false // Note: Only use in development, not recommended for production
  })
});
```

### 4. Check for Mixed Content

Ensure all resources (images, scripts, API calls) use HTTPS, not HTTP. You can use browser developer tools to identify mixed content issues.

### 5. Test with Different Browsers

Sometimes SSL issues can be browser-specific. Try submitting the form in different browsers to see if the issue persists.

### 6. Render.com Support

If none of the above solutions work, contact Render.com support as there might be a specific configuration needed for your application.

## Prevention for Future Deployments

1. Always use HTTPS URLs in production environment variables
2. Test your application thoroughly after deployment
3. Consider using a service like SSL Labs to test your SSL configuration
4. Implement proper error handling in your frontend code to provide more helpful error messages
